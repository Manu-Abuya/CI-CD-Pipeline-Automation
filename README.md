# CI-CD-Pipeline-Automation

This repository contains the code and documentation for the CI/CD Pipeline Automation project, which focuses on automating the build, testing, and deployment of applications using GitHub as the source code repository. The project utilizes various tools such as Jenkins, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CodePipeline to achieve continuous integration and deployment.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a robust CI/CD pipeline that streamlines the development and deployment process, ensuring consistent code quality and reducing manual deployment efforts. The pipeline automates the following stages:

1. **Source Control**: The project code is hosted on GitHub, allowing for version control and collaboration among team members.

2. **Build Automation**: Jenkins is used to trigger the build process using AWS CodeBuild. The build service compiles and packages the application code.

3. **Testing Automation**: Automated tests, integrated with the pipeline, help ensure the quality of the application. Test reports and coverage reports are generated during the pipeline execution.

4. **Deployment Automation**: AWS CodeDeploy deploys the application to different environments, such as development, staging, and production. Deployment configurations and validation mechanisms are implemented to ensure successful deployments.

5. **Pipeline Orchestration**: The entire CI/CD process is orchestrated using AWS CodePipeline. Jenkins is integrated as a CodePipeline action, triggering the pipeline execution.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the application.
- `tests/`: Contains the automated test cases and test scripts.
- `buildspec.yml`: The build specification file that defines the build steps and dependencies.
- `Jenkinsfile`: Jenkins pipeline script that defines the CI/CD pipeline stages.
- `docs/`: Documentation folder containing detailed instructions and resources for setting up and configuring the CI/CD pipeline.
- `scripts/`: Additional scripts or templates for infrastructure provisioning, environment setup, and deployment.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, please refer to the documentation in the `docs/` folder. The documentation provides detailed instructions on setting up the CI/CD pipeline, configuring tools and services, and running the pipeline for your applications.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the CI/CD pipeline, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- An AWS account with the necessary permissions to create resources.
- A GitHub account for hosting the application code.
- Access to a server or cloud instance for installing and configuring Jenkins.
